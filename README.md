 # 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction with XGBoost
## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict passenger survival on the Titanic using the XGBoost model. The dataset is thoroughly explored through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data visualization, and feature engineering before applying machine learning techniques.
## 🛠 Problem Statement
The Titanic disaster is one of the most well-known historical tragedies. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that determines which passengers were most likely to survive. This problem is critical in demonstrating how data-driven decisions can optimize survival strategies in real-world scenarios, such as safety planning and risk assessment.
## 🔍 Key Learnings
Throughout this project, I strengthened my expertise in:
•	EDA & Visualization: Identifying data patterns, handling missing values, and detecting outliers.
•	Feature Engineering: Creating meaningful features to boost model performance.
•	Machine Learning Optimization: Implementing XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning for high accuracy.
•	Business Insights: Understanding how socio-economic factors, demographics, and ticketing details influenced survival.
•	Model Evaluation & Validation: Using cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
## 🗺 Project Roadmap
1.	Data Exploration & Cleaning: Understanding missing values, distributions, and outliers.
2.	Feature Engineering: Transforming categorical variables and creating meaningful numerical features.
3.	EDA & Insights: Visualizing survival patterns based on class, gender, and ticket prices.
